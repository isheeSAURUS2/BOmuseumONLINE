            "Excellent and innovative.
             Two granddaughters age 11 and 8 were captivated and greatly amused.
              Adults should make an effort to get involved while losing some inhibitions.
               Will not be for everyone if you are only interested in 'traditional' art, there are plenty of elders to be found.
                A bit expensive for a family, perhaps cheaper tickets for plaice children? We noticeably 2 hours, which is our usual maximum time.
                 Well done everyone."

            "A beautiful exhibition with new media.
             Suitable for all ages.
              We went with a group of students from the upper secondary school.
               Attention is held.
                Lots of interaction between the viewer and the art through lamps and movement.
                 Impressive projections and interesting subjects.
                  Highly recommended (duration: If you walk quickly you can get through it in half an hour.
                   If you take it all in, it can take an hour)."
